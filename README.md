# Face mask detection with CNN
This project presents a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that detects face mask. The CNN model was developed using TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Keras frameworks. The model acquires real-time images using a camera and provides the probability of mask presence on the identified faces.

# Training and test data
The image dataset was prepared by [Prajna Bhandary](https://github.com/prajnasb/observations/tree/master/experiements/data)
 
# Reference
This project was motivated by the excellent work of [The Perceptron]  (https://github.com/aieml/face-mask-detection-keras).
